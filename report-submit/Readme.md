# Course Project Fall 2023 - CSC 6850

This is course project of CSC 6850 i.e Intro to machine learning.

Here, we implemented three different semi supervised learning algorithm.

Once the zip file is extracted, you will see two files, that are:

1. load_mnist.ipynb
2. two_moons.ipynb


Since, the project was done in google collab, the notebook with results were downloaded. 
For installation, simply upload this notebook file into google drive and run from google collab or we can share the code in google collab once the email is provided. 

## To run code in your own system.
In case, where we had to run the code in our system, requirements.txt file is to required. Even if requirements.txt is not present, you might be able to run the code if you installed `tensorflow`, `matplotlib`, `numpy` & `sklearn`. 

For [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip),[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html), [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/), [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) installation, follow the guide provided.
